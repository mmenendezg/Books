Use t-SNE to reduce the MNIST dataset down to two dimensions and plot the result using Matplotlib. You can use a scatterplot using 10 different colors to represent each image’s target class. Alternatively, you can replace each dot in the scatterplot with the corresponding instance’s class (a digit from 0 to 9), or even plot scaled-down versions of the digit images themselves (if you plot all digits,\n","the visualization will be too cluttered, so you should either draw a random sample or plot an instance only if no other instance has already been plotted at a close distance).

Try using other dimensionality reduction algorithms such as PCA, LLE, or MDS and compare the resulting visualizations."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"94_w11gKD4tu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636585032394,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":288,"user":{"displayName":"Marlon Melendez Gonzalez","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"09912489951152204402"}},"outputId":"9dcd3bf8-0f99-46eb-d204-bbc256a98929"},"source":["help(t_sne.Pep562)"],"execution_count":48,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Help on class Pep562 in module sklearn.externals._pep562:\n","\n","class Pep562(builtins.object)\n"," |  Pep562(name)\n"," |  \n"," |  Backport of PEP 562 <https://pypi.org/search/?q=pep562>.\n"," |  \n"," |  Wraps the module in a class that exposes the mechanics to override `__dir__` and `__getattr__`.\n"," |  The given module will be searched for overrides of `__dir__` and `__getattr__` and use them when needed.\n"," |  \n"," |  Methods defined here:\n"," |  \n"," |  __dir__(self)\n"," |      Return the overridden `dir` if one was provided, else apply `dir` to the module.\n"," |  \n"," |  __getattr__(self, name)\n"," |      Attempt to retrieve the attribute from the module, and if missing, use the overridden function if present.\n"," |  \n"," |  __init__(self, name)\n"," |      Acquire `__getattr__` and `__dir__`, but only replace module for versions less than Python 3.7.\n"," |  \n"," |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n"," |  Data descriptors defined here:\n"," |  \n"," |  __dict__\n"," |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)\n"," |  \n"," |  __weakref__\n"," |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)\n","\n"]}]}]}
