For each test set instance, generate the predictions of\n","the 1,000 Decision Trees, and keep only the most frequent prediction (you can\n","use SciPy’s mode() function for this). This approach gives you majority-vote\n","predictions over the test set.\n","- Evaluate these predictions on the test set: you should obtain a slightly higher accuracy than your first model (about 0.5 to 1.5% higher).
