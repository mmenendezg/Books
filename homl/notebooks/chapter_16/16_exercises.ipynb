    "### 8. Embedded Reber grammars were used by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in [their paper](https://homl.info/93) about LSTMs. They are artificial grammars that produce strings such as “BPBTSXXVPSEPE”. Check out [Jenny Orr’s nice introduction](https://homl.info/108) to this topic, then choose a particular embedded Reber grammar (such as the one represented on Orr’s page), then train an RNN to identify whether a string respects that grammar or not. You will first need to write a function capable of generating a training batch containing about 50% strings that respect the grammar, and 50% that don’t."

You will learn how to build a model capable of representing both images and text within the same embedding space. This makes it possible to search for images using a text prompt, like in the CLIP model by OpenAI."
