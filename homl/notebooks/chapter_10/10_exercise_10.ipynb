    "### 10. Train a deep MLP on the MNIST dataset (you can load it using keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(). See if you can get over 98% precision. Try searching for the optimal learning rate by using the approach presented in this chapter (i.e., by growing the learning rate exponentially, plotting the error, and finding the point where the error shoots up). Try adding all the bells and whistlesâ€”save checkpoints, use early stopping, and plot learning curves using TensorBoard."
